# designPatterns

From Head First Design Patterns

1. Identity the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays
2. Program to an Interface, not an Implementation
3. Favor Composition over Inheritance. HAS-A relationship is better than IS-A relationship (Strategy Pattern)
4. Strive for loose coupled designs between objects that Interact. (Observer Pattern)
5. Classes should be Open for Extension, closed for Modification. (Decorator Pattern)
6. Factory method relies on inheritance. Object creation is delegated to Subclasses which implement the Factory Interface to create objects.
7. Abstract Factory relies on composition. Object creation is delegated to methods exposed in Factory interface.
8. All Factory patterns promote loose coupling by reducing the dependencies of application on concrete classes.
9. SimpleFactory just decouples the client code from instantiating the objects.
