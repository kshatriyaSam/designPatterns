# designPatterns

From Head First Design Patterns

1. Identity the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays
2. Program to an Interface, not an Implementation
3. Favor Composition over Inheritance. HAS-A relationship is better than IS-A relationship (Strategy Pattern)
4. Strive for loose coupled designs between objects that Interact. (Observer Pattern)
5. Classes should be Open for Extension, closed for Modification. (Decorator Pattern)
